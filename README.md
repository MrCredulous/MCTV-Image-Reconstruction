## Prerequisite

- MATLAB R2014a or newer version

## Usage
- For demonstration, simply clone the repository and run `main.m`. Reconstruction results of TV and MCTV as well as error images are drawn. Below is one demo figure: (a) original brain image; (b) random template with 30% sampling rate and 0.1 sampling radius; (c) reconstructed image using standard TV penalty; (d) reconstructed image using MCTV penalty; (e) difference between (a) and (c); (f) difference between (a) and (d).

- I offered 2 brain images and 3 sampling templates (random, radial and Cartesian) for testing. Feel free to modify different parts of comments in `main.m` to switch and try. Of course, the optimized parameter values of different images and templates may vary.

- Furthermore, you can tailor sampling rates and methods via functions in `masks`. There is also a `README.md` inside to help you.

- For more algorithm details, please see `rec_tv.m` and `rec_mctv.m` or the relevant research paper.
